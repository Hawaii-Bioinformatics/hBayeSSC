The script, execute.py (need a better name), should work with openscience grid (if they truely uses a minimum of python 2.4).  
The program has several command line options, which can be found using the -h option when executing the script.  Here is a sample execution lines and their explanations:

python execution.py -p bss_con_expan.par -i obs_NWHI -r 10 -u 1 -b ./BayeSSC -t 1000:200000  -m 20

-p : the par file we will use as a template.  the python script expects the par in a similar format
-i : the observation file.  This is a tab delimited file, in which the 1st line is a header line.  See the obs_NWHI for the valid headers
-r : How many times we repeat the execution of BayeSSC for a given model
-u : a unique identifier.  This can be a string or a number.  It prefixes the index value.  The index is made up of 6 components <uid>_<congruent count>_<total obs>_<trail/repeat #>_<random number with . replaced by _>_<timestamp with . replaced by _>
-b : the path to where BayeSSC is.  If it isn't supplied, it assumes it is on the Users PATH
-t : the time Range in which we can randomly select times from.  This is here instead of in the par file, since we now use python to randomly select a time value.
-m : specify which model to execute.  If -m is not provided, it will execute all models.

-o : defines where to generate your output.  By default it generates your output in the current working directory

#> python execute.py -h

usage: execution.py [options]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p FILE, --par=FILE   par file template [required]
  -i FILE, --obs=FILE   Observation file [required]
  -r NUM, --repeat=NUM  Number of times to try a given congruent group size
                        [required]
  -m MODEL, --model=MODEL
                        Run a single model (0 to total entries in observation
                        file) [default: run all models]
  -u UID, --uid=UID     Unique ID to prefix generated indices [required]
  -l TYPE, --LRType=TYPE
                        Loci Rate Priori Type
  -o PATH, --outdir=PATH
                        Directory to generate output in (will create missing
                        folders) [default: /home/landcaster/yvonne/test/pytest]
  -t RANGE, --timerange=RANGE
                        The range of values to select the time from
                        (Integers). Example: 1000:20000  [required]
  -b PATH, --bayepath=PATH
                        Path to BayeSSC application [default: Located on user
                        PATH]
  --mutate              When set uses the mutlow and muthigh columns instead
                        of locilow/locihigh for subsitution into the par file
